Overview
This project implements a Array Abstract Data Type (ADT) that encapsulates the functionality of string manipulation. The Array ADT provides a robust and efficient way to handle arrays, allowing users to perform various operations without dealing with low-level details.
Creation: Initialize an array with a specified size and data type.
Access: Retrieve an element using its index.
Modification: Update the value of an element at a specific index.
Traversal: Iterate through all elements in the array.
Searching: Find the position of a specific element (linear or binary search).
Insertion and Deletion: While arrays support insertion and deletion, these operations can be inefficient (O(n)) since they may require shifting elements.
