Basic Operations:
Creation: Create strings from character arrays or literals.
Concatenation: Combine two or more strings into a single string.
Substring: Extract a portion of a string.
Comparison: Compare two strings lexicographically.
Search: Find the occurrence of a substring within a string.
Manipulation: Functions to convert strings to uppercase/lowercase, trim whitespace, and replace characters.
